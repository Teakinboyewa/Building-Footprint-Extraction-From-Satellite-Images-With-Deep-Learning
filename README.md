## Building Footprint Extraction from Satellite Images with Deep learning Project

Humbly published this repo in pursuits of trying our utmost to be a great lift for Myanmar Geoinformatic and Machine learning society. Since both contributors were still at their grittiest learning phase, sincere apologies are delivered if any mistakes or inconveiences are encountered.

This project aims to help beginners in both Geospatial technology and deep learning to understand and work out a particular segmentation project on their own.
There are two tracks with 
- one for using our model to extract building footprint his/her own needs
- one for those who would like to gain details insight on our project 

# For those who would like to use our model, please go through 
- 3.Inference.ipynb 

# For those longing for details, please go through
- 1. Generate Images.ipynb
- 2. Train.ipynb
- 3. Inference
- 4. Geo-process.ipynb


# Utils
- image_utils.py (used for image preprocessing and postprocessing )
- geoprocess.py ( used for georeferencing and shapefile conversion )
- loss.py ( used to import custom loss function into model )

# Weights

Pretrained weights can be seen here.
